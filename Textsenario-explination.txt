    First of all i tested and creat text cases both api and ui test scenarios

    I tested manually one by one many times    on api and ui part also found bugs , I tried one way if you could
    not handle with my approach some cases .1. first bug during the manual testing is that "tempInFahrenheit":51 =
    10 celsius) i updated temp endpoint but it showed cold actually it should be "mild"  condition is
     celsius<10  but  not equal 10. 2.second bug is:IF celsius=20-24 Should be shown "warm" based on AC
    But it showed nothing it showed like that "description": "The weather is ",3.Bug is if we send and update
     condition=4  corresponding value  should drizzle.png not like that" icon": "drizzle.jpeg", it showed jpeg it sould be
     png.
